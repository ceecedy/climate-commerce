# Database Directory

This directory contains the `database.db` file, which is used for [insert brief description of what the database contains or is used for].

However, due to the file size exceeding 50 MB, I decided **not to push it to the remote Git repository**. GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB per file for repositories, and as `database.db` is larger than that, I chose to exclude it from version control.

If you need to work with this database locally, you can download it directly from [insert relevant source or location where the database is hosted or can be retrieved from, if applicable].

### Important Notes:
- The `database.db` file is **excluded from version control** by being added to the `.gitignore` file.
- Please ensure you have the proper access to the database file if you need it for development or testing purposes.

Thank you for understanding!
