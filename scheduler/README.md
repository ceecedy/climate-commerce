# Scheduler: Automating Data Processing Tasks

## Introduction

The **Scheduler** is responsible for automating the execution of tasks in the data processing pipeline. It ensures that the orchestrator runs at predefined intervals, allowing for automated and timely data processing. Currently, there's no scheduler setup for it does not needed.

### Future Enhancements

The scheduler will be expanded to:
1. **Event-Driven Triggers**: Trigger jobs based on events such as data arrival or system changes.
2. **Scalable Scheduling**: Support scheduling of tasks on a distributed system for high scalability.
3. **Integration with Cloud Services**: Utilize cloud-based scheduling tools like **AWS Lambda**, **Azure Functions**, or **Apache Airflow** for more flexibility and automation.
