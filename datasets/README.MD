# Datasets

This directory contains the data sources used in the project. All the datasets used were uploaded excluding one because of its size and Github can't host it.

## Why one Dataset is missing?

It is because of its size that is more than 50 MB, so they have been **excluded from version control**. This is a common practice to avoid bloating the repository with large files and to ensure smooth collaboration across team members.

## Accessing the Datasets

The datasets used in this project are available on Kaggle. Specifically, we are using the **Brazilian E-commerce Dataset** from **O-list**, which contains detailed information about e-commerce transactions in Brazil.

You can download the dataset directly from Kaggle using the following link:
