# Analytics Directory

This directory contains the output model files, which is the csv representation of the model outputs. These csv's are used for the dashboarding and analytics.

However, some files are exceeding from 50 MB, specifically they are containing gigabytes of size. It cannot be pushed to the remote repository **GitHub** since it has a file size limit of 100 MB per file for repositories. I chose to exclude it from version control.

### Output Files not Included:
- `dim_customers`
- `dim_geolocation`

Thank you for understanding!
